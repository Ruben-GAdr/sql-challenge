This code helps you to set a dataset in order to work with queries using postgresql

Only you must create database "Employees" and run code contained in file Schema_employees.sql in order to set tables

Then you shoul upload tables in this order
File titles.csv to populate table titles
File departments.csv to populate table departments
File employees.csv to populate table employees
File salaries.csv to populate table salaries
File dept_manager to populate table dept_mng
File dept:emp to populate table dept_empl

Now you are ready to work with the information.

Best regards.
